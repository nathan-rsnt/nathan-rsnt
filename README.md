# Hello there ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
I am a Software Engineer with a passion for Cyber Security. I enjoy working on projects that allow me to apply my knowledge in both software development and ethical hacking.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on an automated pentesting tool as my final project for my Computer Science degree.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning C++.

## My Projects

### [Automated Pentesting Tool for Network and Web Vulnerability Detection and Exploitation](https://github.com/nathanrsnt/inside)

- An automated pentesting tool that scans networks and websites for vulnerabilities. Upon finding a vulnerability, the application attempts to exploit it and reports back to the user if the exploitation was successful.
